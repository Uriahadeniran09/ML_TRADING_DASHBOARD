Project C — A Full-Stack ML Trading Dashboard

Combine your SWE strengths with quant:

Python backend with ML forecasts

React/Flutter frontend showing:

price charts

risk metrics

model predictions

Live data from AlphaVantage or Polygon API

This would differentiate you from typical quant candidates.


i wanna do this break it down for me, what exactly is this ?

You said:
I'm gonna do this as an app or site ?
You said:
I will use a website then and I will use vscode . Sounds good ?


🚀 What Exactly Is This Project?

It’s a web or mobile application that:

Pulls live market data (stock prices, volume, etc.)

Runs ML models (e.g., price forecast, volatility prediction)

Computes portfolio + risk metrics

Displays everything on a clean UI using React or Flutter

Updates in real-time (charts, predictions)

It combines:

Quant skills (math/stats/finance)

ML skills (time-series, forecasting)

SWE skills (backend, frontend, APIs)

This is the kind of project JPMorgan, Two Sigma, Citadel, BlackRock, and Point72 LOVE to see because it proves you can:

build a system end-to-end

understand markets

deploy ML in production

code like a real engineer

think like a quant

📦 THE PROJECT, BROKEN INTO 4 SIMPLE PARTS
PART 1 — Data Pipeline (Real-Time Market Data)
Pick your data source

Use one of these:

Polygon.io — best API, real-time (paid but has free tier)

AlphaVantage — free and great for students

Yahoo Finance (yfinance package) — free but slower, still great for historical data

You will build:

✔ A Python script that:

pulls stock prices every X seconds/minutes

stores them in a database (or cache like Redis)

cleans & formats them

sends the cleaned data to your backend API

Output example (data dictionary):
{
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-05T14:30:00",
  "open": 198.5,
  "close": 199.2,
  "high": 200.1,
  "low": 197.8,
  "volume": 24412000
}


This is your "raw material" for ML + dashboard visualizations.

PART 2 — ML Models (Time Series + Risk Forecasting)

Your backend will run two types of models:

Model A — Price Prediction

You choose one:

LSTM (classic deep learning time-series model)

GRU

Random Forest Regressor

ARIMA/SARIMA (traditional quant model)

XGBoost (works great on structured data)

Inputs: last N days/minutes of price data
Output: predicted price for next timestep

Model B — Volatility or Risk Model

Examples:

GARCH volatility model

Rolling standard deviation

Value-at-Risk (Historical VaR)

Sharpe ratio calculation

These are easy to code and look VERY “quant.”

Example output:

{
  "predicted_price": 201.10,
  "predicted_volatility": 0.017,
  "value_at_risk_95": -3.44
}

PART 3 — Backend API (Python FastAPI or Flask)

Your backend will expose endpoints like:

Endpoints the frontend will call:
GET /price?symbol=AAPL
GET /history?symbol=AAPL&period=1y
GET /prediction?symbol=AAPL
GET /risk?symbol=AAPL
POST /portfolio/optimize

What backend components you need:

✔ FastAPI or Flask app
✔ Data fetching service
✔ ML prediction service
✔ Risk model service
✔ A database (SQLite/Postgres) or just local storage
✔ Deployment via Render, Railway, or Vercel

PART 4 — Frontend (React or Flutter)

This is where your SWE skills shine.

Screens you will build:
📈 1. Stock Dashboard Screen

Shows:

Candlestick chart

Predictions overlay

Time-series graphs

Volume graph

📊 2. Risk Metrics Screen

Displays:

Volatility

VaR

Sharpe

Max drawdown

Correlation heatmap (if portfolio mode)

🤖 3. ML Predictions Screen

Displays:

Next 1–5 timesteps predicted

Confidence interval

Trend indicator (UP / DOWN)

Model explanation (LIME/SHAP if you want bonus points)

💼 4. Portfolio Optimization Screen

Optional but massive flex.

Use:

Markowitz Efficient Frontier

PyPortfolioOpt library

Features:

User enters their tickers

Dashboard computes optimal weights

Graph of efficient frontier

Expected return vs risk

🧨 FINAL OUTPUT — What It Will Look Like

Your project will look like a Bloomberg-lite trading dashboard with:

Real-time stock charts

Predicted next price

Expected volatility

Risk metrics

Portfolio optimization

A full UI built by you

A full ML backend built by you
